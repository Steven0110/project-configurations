# project-configurations
This repo will contain all configuration files I use to develop my web applications in several frameworks.

All packages defined will be the latest (but stable) ones. They are previously tested by me, so there should not be any version and compatibility issues.
It is worth mentioning that I develop in Ubuntu/Debian, with Node 12 LTS installed via Node Version Manager.

This repo is for personal use, but if I see that it is useful for someone else, maybe I will work in something more generic.
